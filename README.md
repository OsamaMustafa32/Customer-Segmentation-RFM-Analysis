1. **Project Objective:** 
   - Conduct Customer Segmentation Analysis for an Automobile Bike Company.
   - Utilize an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to segment customers based on their transaction history.

2. **RFM Analysis:**
   - RFM model categorizes customers into segments based on three key metrics:
     - Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.
     - Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.
     - Monetary: How much money a customer spends on purchases.
   - These metrics enable the identification of customer segments with distinct buying behaviors.

3. **Segmentation Strategy:**
   - Divide customers into 11 distinct groups based on their RFM scores.
   - Each group represents a unique segment with specific characteristics.
   - The segmentation assists in determining which customer segments to target to enhance sales revenue.

4. **Sales Dashboard Development:**
   - Develop a Sales Dashboard using Tableau.
   - The Dashboard visualizes the segmented customer data, providing insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
   - Visualization aids in understanding customer segments and formulating targeted sales strategies.

5. **Data Quality Assessment and Analysis:**
   - Use Python for data quality assessment and analysis.
   - Ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data used for RFM analysis.
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into customer behavior and transaction patterns.

6. **Project Outcome:**
   - Gain actionable insights into customer segments, allowing for targeted marketing and sales efforts.
   - Enhance sales revenue by focusing on high-value customer segments identified through RFM analysis.
   - Improve decision-making processes based on data-driven insights derived from customer segmentation analysis.
